# ByteBit-Huffman Coding Compression System Documentation

The Huffman Coding Compression System is a software tool that utilizes the Huffman coding algorithm to compress and decompress files. Huffman coding is a popular lossless data compression algorithm that assigns variable-length codes to different characters based on their frequencies in the input file.

## Introduction

The Huffman Coding Compression System provides a means to compress files, reducing their size while preserving data integrity. It achieves this by using Huffman coding, a variable-length prefix coding technique that assigns shorter codes to more frequently occurring characters.

## Features

- Compresses files using the Huffman coding algorithm
- Decompresses Huffman-encoded files back to their original form
- Supports various file formats, including text files, images, and more
- User-friendly command-line interface

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aryan-139/bytebit
